            <blockquote>
              In telecommunications, a communication protocol is a system of rules that allow two or more entities of a communication system to communicate between them to transmit information via any kind of variation of a physical quantity.

             Wireshark is THE way to analyze packet traffic. Supports hundreds of protocols.
             Here you can see the binary of the packet on the bottom and what it means on the top.

             You can of course also anaylze text-based protocols with it too.

              So back to our traffic here. This is SMB, which we'll talk more about in a minute. Wireshark understands what the chunks of binary data mean
              and is able to create this interface for you so that you can make sense of the data in relation to a protocol spec.

          <section>
            <p>Let's take a quick look at a spec for an easy binary protocol (i.e. NOT SMB)</p>
            <aside class="notes">
              We thought it would be useful to show what a super-simple spec looks like for a protocol that many people in the room are probably already familiar with.

          <section>
            <h3>Example: Apple Push Notification (APN) protocol</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Super-simple protocol</li>
              <li>Asynchronous</li>
              <li>Used to send notifications on iDevices</li>
            </ul>

              If you have an iDevice, you're very familiar with these.

            <p>So simple, we can show format in a picture:</p>

            <aside class="notes">
              Ok so what does that mean though? How does that diagram relate to what the machine needs?
              Think of a packet as like a tightly packed suitcase. The suitcase needs the right things, of the right size, in the right places.

              Each piece of the data that is expected in the protocol is enumerated in this spec
              Remember our packet? We create a structured piece of binary data (a binary string)

            <aside class="notes">
              Now we need to make sure that we can place binary information on the wire.
              We need to be structuring literal bits in memory. We need C structs.

              We're creating an instance of our struct and setting up the values of its components,

            <blockquote>
              A struct in the C programming language (and many derivatives) is a complex data type declaration that <span class="fragment highlight-blue">defines a physically grouped list of variables to be placed under one name in a block of memory</span>, allowing the different variables to be accessed via a single pointer, or the struct declared name which returns the same address.

              Physically. Adjacent. In memory. Think about that - that means ones and zeroes. Physically adjacent. Keep this concept in your head.

            <p>A packet is just a struct!</p>
            <aside class="notes">
              So if we know that a packet is just a struct, then it should be easy to follow a protocol spec and put them out on the wire.
              All we need to do now is make structs in Ruby.

            <h2>BinData</h2>
            <p>A library for building C structs in Ruby so that you can deal with binary data in a Ruby-ish way</p>
            <aside class="notes">
              You need to be able to use all the lovely things about Ruby (classes, DSLs, etc) to make C-style structs.
              This means packing regular Ruby strings as binary
            </aside>
          </section>

          <section>
            From the website:
            <blockquote>
              BinData provides a <strong>declarative</strong> way to read and write structured binary data.
            </blockquote>
          </section>

          <section>
            A nice little DSL for making OG structs...
            <pre>
            <code data-trim>
class Rectangle < BinData::Record
  endian :little
  uint16 :len
  string :name, :read_length => :len
  uint32 :width
  uint32 :height
end

io = File.open(...)
r  = Rectangle.read(io)
puts "Rectangle #{r.name} is #{r.width} x #{r.height}"
            </code>
            </pre>
            <aside class="notes">
              OK so now we know that we can write (and read!) C structs with a handy DSL
              It makes strings of binary data that can easily be reasoned about.
            </aside>
          </section>

          <section>
            <p>So let's recap the tools/knowledge we have:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>We know how packets are structured</li>
              <li>We know how a binary protocol spec is organized (from APN)</li>
              <li>We have a way to produce binary structures for the wire</li>
            </ul>
            <aside>
