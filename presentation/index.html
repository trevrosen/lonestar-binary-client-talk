              In telecommunications, a communication protocol is a system of rules that allow two or more entities of a communication system to communicate between them to transmit information via any kind of <span class="fragment highlight-blue">variation of a physical quantity.</span>

              Wireshark is THE way to analyze packet traffic. Supports hundreds of protocols.

            <p>Let's take a quick look at a spec for an easy binary protocol (i.e. NOT SMB)</p>

              We thought it would be useful to show what a super-simple spec looks like for a protocol that many people in the room are probably already familiar with.

              Ok so what does that mean though? How does that diagram relate to what the machine needs?
              Think of a packet as like a tightly packed suitcase. The suitcase needs the right things, of the right size, in the right places.

              This is a talk about clients, right? Not hacker stuff!  Well we
              need to know what hosts are routeable in order to do a pivot

          <h3>Metasploit network clients must create their own sockets</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>This is why we make lots of protocol clients</li>
            <li>We have to instantiate the socket in the context of the routes made available by pivots, at runtime</li>
          </ul>

          <aside class="notes">
            Most ruby protocols handle socket creation for you with something like TCPSocket. We have more restrictions.

          <h4>Client</h4>
          <p>The thing that holds the current protocol state</p>

            <li>what dialect are we using?</li>
            <li>was authentication successful?</li>
